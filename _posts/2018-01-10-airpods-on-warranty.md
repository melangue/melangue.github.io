I've bought my pair of AirPods in January of 2017 and fell in love immediately. No wires, (mostly) frictionless pairing, no stuttering - awesome.
This is my favourite gadget since a long time and I've been using them regularly - in a gym, on the street when out and about and of course in the office I work at.
At this point is hard for me to imagine a pair of headphones *with* a wire and people in earbuds with cables sticking out of their ears started to look weird.
But now, unfortunately I have to return them for a guarantee and I'm (maybe not literally) but in pain.

## What happened?

Physics, wear and tear.
Ever since I bought them there has been a slight difference between both of the batteries - one lasted slightly longer than the other.
Nothing major, the difference would be 5% at most and I only noticed because I've been checking the battery levels like a maniac.
Now the difference itself is nothing alarming, after all that is how batteries work - they never hold the same amount of energy.
I've thought of returning them but at this point I've had them for more then a month and this was the time when they were really hard to get.
So I did not do it.

But now, after (almost) a year it has become a problem.
It got to the point that the AirPods battery level in the iOS widget shows their battery levels apart. The difference sometimes comes up to around 15% so I got worried.
