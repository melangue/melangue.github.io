I'm an Apple Music subscriber, and I listen to a lot of music. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the service except for some personal nitpicks.

I also like sharing music which I listen to and Apple Music makes it pretty easy - that is if your friends are using it and mine are not.

Some of them (those who use any service) are on Spotify but most of them just listen to music on YouTube... go figure.

I can't (and don't want to) keep track of who uses what so I've decided some time ago to make my life easier with Workflow.

This is how it works:

* Get currently playing music in Artist - Track name format
* Replace some characters with regex
* Search for it on YouTube (in the background)
* Find link to the first search result (in the background)
* Share the link - Open / Copy to clipboard / Share Sheet

That's it! It takes a couple of seconds to process a song but it works straight from the Notification Center widget so it's really seamless.

Now I know there are some apps which make music sharing easy, but I find this workflow easiest to use. All in all I just want to share the song and I want to do it as quickly as possible.

Below you'll find iOS music apps worth mentioning:

* SongShift - Move playlists between Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and many more - I use this app to move playlists from Apple Music to Spotify so I can listen to my music while I'm playing on my PS4
* SoundShare - Social network for Music. You can follow your friends, listen to their music (no matter the music service), build collaborative playlists, and send universal links which open the music service app you are using, etc.
* Songlink - web app - Find songs and get a universal link which can contain links to that song on every music streaming service
